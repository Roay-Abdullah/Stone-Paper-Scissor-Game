# Stone Paper Scissors Game

## Description

This is my first JavaScript project - a classic Stone Paper Scissors game implemented with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows users to play against the computer, keeping track of scores and providing instant feedback on game outcomes.

## Features

- Interactive gameplay against a computer opponent
- Real-time score tracking
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Visually appealing UI with hover effects
- Instant feedback messages on game results

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Click on one of the three options: Stone, Paper, or Scissors.
3. The computer will randomly choose its option.
4. The game will determine the winner and update the score.
5. The result message will be displayed below the options.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the game structure.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling the game interface.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the game logic.
- `Stone.png`, `Paper.png`, `Scissor.png`: Image files for the game options.

## Code Highlights

- Use of `querySelectorAll` and `addEventListener` for handling user interactions.
- Implementation of computer's random choice using `Math.random()`.
- Modular functions for different aspects of the game (e.g., `generateCompOption`, `checkWinner`).
- Dynamic updating of the DOM to reflect game state and scores.

## Future Improvements

- Add animations for a more interactive experience.
- Implement a best-of-three or best-of-five game mode.
- Add sound effects for different game outcomes.
- Create a mobile-friendly version of the game.
